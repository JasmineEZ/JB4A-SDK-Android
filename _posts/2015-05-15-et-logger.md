We have enhanced the logging capabilities in the 4.0.0 release significantly in order to assist you in using the SDK.  Please turn on logging when you call readyAimFire() (for more information see [Implement the SDK for Google]({{ site.baseurl }}/sdk-implementation/implement-sdk-google.html) or [Implement the SDK for Amazon]({{ site.baseurl }}/sdk-implementation/implement-sdk-amazon.html):

~~~
    // turn on verbose logging if this is not a release build
    if (Utils.isDebugApp(this)) {
        pushConfigBuilder.setLogLevel(Log.DEBUG);
    }
~~~

These logging statements are put in the ADB logcat when you run your app.  However, they can be transient as well as hard to pull off a device if you're testing with production or other devices that aren't necessarily connected to a development machine.

So, in this release, we have added the ET Logger class that allows you to request logs be written to a file.  And then you can have this file sent to you.  We use it for our internal testing, but thought you might enjoy having this flexibility.

The following examples are taken from the <a href="https://github.com/ExactTarget/JB4A-SDK-Android/tree/master/JB4A-SDK-Explorer" target="_blank">Journey Builder for Apps SDK Explorer for Android</a>.

Anytime after readyAimFire() is called, you can start to capture the SDK logs:

~~~
    // ETLogger.startCapture(maxMemorySize, maxFileSize)
    //
    //      Since we are in debug mode, make sure to capture the log to a file
    //      We are choosing not to clear the log when we start so that we can get a
    //      continuous log of our testing.
    //
    ETLogger.getInstance().startCapture(this, 100000l, 1000000l, false);
~~~

When you have captured what you want, you can stop capture:

~~~
    // stop capturing log
    ETLogger.getInstance().stopCapture();
~~~ 

You can send the logging to a specific email or have the user enter the email directly:

~~~
    String[] emailAddresses = {""};
    ETLogger.getInstance().emailLogFile(SDK_ExplorerDebugSettingsActivity.this, 
                                        emailAddresses, 
                                        "Android JB4A SDK Explorer Debug Info", 
                                        "Here is the logfile from the JB4A SDK.");
