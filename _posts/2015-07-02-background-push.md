#### Silent Push Messages for MobilePush
This document contains conceptual and procedural information about sending a silent push message to a mobile app using the MobilePush app and the REST API.

#### What are Silent Push Messages
A silent push message appears on a mobile app without triggering a visual or audible alert on the mobile device. Examples include subscriptions read inside the Google Newsstand app or updates to messages within an app that do not require notifications.

#### How to Send Silent Push Messages
Follow the steps below to create and send silent push messages:

1. Create an API-triggered MobilePush message.
1. Ensure you set the **content-available** property to **1**.
1. Set the override property to true.
1. Use the sample payload below as a model for your own message:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/sfmc-mobilepushsdk/4f4ab7311a39657e9356.js"></script>

Once you create the original message, you can pass text to the message using subsequent messages as part of the Override value.

#### Receiving Silent Push Messages
Silent Push Messages post to the EventBus as a 
[SilentPushReceivedEvent]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/eventbus.html). Extract the payload from this event and to act upon.
