To implement contact segmentation by tags, include code to set tags for subscriptions as defined by user choice.

Tags will be saved in the user's Contact record. All Tags are included in the Registration payload sent to the Marketing Cloud and will replace all tags currently stored in the Contact record. Users can review tags in the Contact record within the Marketing Cloud website.

> NOTE: The SDK will send changes to {{ page.feature }} to the Marketing Cloud with a REST call one minute after the first change to any Marketing Cloud data. If the REST call fails (no network for example), then it will retry in one minute intervals until the app is suspended. If the send is unsuccessful before the app is suspended, the data will be sent the next time the app is opened. It will take up to {{ site.propagationDelay }} for this value to be recorded in the Contact record once the REST call is made by the SDK."
