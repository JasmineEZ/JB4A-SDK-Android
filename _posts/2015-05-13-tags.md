To implement contact segmentation by tags, include code to set tags for subscriptions as defined by user choice.

Tags will be saved in the user's Contact record. All Tags are included in the Registration payload sent to the Marketing Cloud and will replace all tags currently stored in the Contact record. Users can review tags in the Contact record within the Marketing Cloud website.

The `ETPush.getInstance().addTag()` and `ETPush.getInstance().removeTag()` methods will create a new `Registration` record and send it to the Marketing Cloud. It will take up to {{ site.propagationDelay }} for this value to be recorded in the Contact record. If the internet is not available when the update is made, or an error occurs, the SDK will save the update and retry until the update is successful.

> NOTE: Tags may not be null nor may they be an empty string. Also, leading and/or trailing whitespace will be trimmed from the input.
