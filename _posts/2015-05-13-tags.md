To implement contact segmentation by tags, include code to set tags for subscriptions as defined by user choice.

This example (taken from the <a href="https://github.com/ExactTarget/JB4A-SDK-Android/tree/master/JB4A-SDK-Explorer" target="_blank">Journey Builder for Apps SDK Explorer for Android</a>) uses a PreferenceActivity to allow your users to change which tags they subscribe to. Tags will be saved in their Contact record. All tags are included in registration payload sent to the Marketing Cloud and will replace all tags currently stored in the contact record. Users can review tags in the contact record within the Marketing Cloud app.

The ETPush.getInstance().addTag() and ETPush.getInstance().removeTag() methods will create a new registration record and send it to the Marketing Cloud. It will take up to 15 minutes for this value to be recorded in the Contact record. If the internet is not available when the update is made, the SDK will save the update and send whenever the network becomes available.
