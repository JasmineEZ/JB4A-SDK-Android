If you use ProGuard to protect your production app, you must include the following statement to ensure that the methods in the SDK are not obfuscated:

~~~
   -keep class com.exacttarget.etpushsdk.** { *; }
   -keepattributes Extends,Exceptions,InnerClasses

~~~

> Failure to add these ProGuard statements will result in failures within the SDK.
