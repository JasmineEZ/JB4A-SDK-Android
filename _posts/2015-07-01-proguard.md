If you use ProGuard to protect your production app, you must include the following statement to ensure that the non-obfuscated methods in the SDK::

~~~
   -keep class com.exacttarget.etpushsdk.** { *; }
   -keepattributes InnerClasses

~~~

> Failure to add these ProGuard statements will result in failures within the SDK.
